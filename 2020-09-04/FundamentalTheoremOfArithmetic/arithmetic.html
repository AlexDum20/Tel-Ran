            <p>In number theory, the <strong>fundamental theorem of arithmetic</strong>, also called the <strong>unique
                factorization theorem</strong> or the <strong>unique-prime-factorization theorem</strong>, states that every integer
                greater than 1[3] either is a prime number itself or can be represented as the product of prime numbers
                and that, moreover, this representation is unique, up to (except for) the order of the factors.[4][5][6]
                For example,</p>
            <dd>1200 = 2 <sup>4</sup> × 3<sup>1</sup> × 5<sup>2</sup> = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 5 = 5 × 2 × 5 × 2 × 3 ×
                2 × 2 = ...
            </dd>
            <p>The theorem says two things for this example: first, that 1200 can be represented as a product of primes,
                and second, that no matter how this is done, there will always be exactly four 2s, one 3, two 5s, and no
                other primes in the product.</p>
            <p>The requirement that the factors be prime is necessary: factorizations containing composite numbers may
                not be unique (e.g., 12 = 2 × 6 = 3 × 4).</p>
            <p>This theorem is one of the main reasons why 1 is not considered a prime number: if 1 were prime, then
                factorization into primes would not be unique; for example, 2 = 2 × 1 = 2 × 1 × 1 = ...</p>
